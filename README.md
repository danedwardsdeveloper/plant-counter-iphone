# Plant-Counter iOS app

A simple app to count your weekly plant intake. Created with Expo, React Native and Nativewind; written in TypeScript.

Eating 30 plants per week is much easier than you might think. The main difficulty is just remembering all the possible plants. This app provides a list of around 180 plants to job your memory, and allows you to check them off and tally them up easily.

## Current Features

-  Clean & simple UI, inspired by the Tick Tick to-do list app
-  Sort plants alphabetically or by category
-  [Fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) by plant name or category.

## Features Roadmap

-  Add a custom plant
-  Add a custom plant group (For example, if you regularly have a particular meal that uses the same collection of plants)
-  Linked plants (For example, Peppermint in the Hot drinks category, and Mint in the Herbs category)
-  Favorite plants section
-  Customize plant categories
-  Toggle between American and British spellings
-  About page

-  Social sharing functionality

   -  Screenshot exports in landscape, portrait and square

-  Account system

   -  Store weekly plant intake history
   -  Set week start day
   -  Set targets

## Technologies Used

-  React Native
-  TypeScript
-  Nativewind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)

# The challenges of categorizing plants

I found it very challenging to decide on meaningful group names for the plants. As much as tech nerds like me would love to be able to store everything neatly in a database, nature is like, ~sO rAnDoM, and defies all attempts to classify it eventually.

### Problem plants

-  Chocolate (Hot drink, seed, bean?)
-  Tea (Shrub, herb, hot drink?)
-  Coffee (Bean, seed, hot drink?)
-  Avocado (Stone fruit, fruit as vegetable?)
-  Peanuts (Technically a legume but used as a nut)
-  ...plus many more

## Contributions

I'm planning to charge a subscription for this app once I've expanded the features significantly, so I'm not welcoming contributions.
